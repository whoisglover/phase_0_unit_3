// Pseudocode

// for first function:

// set var to counter function
// loop using for .. in loop
// loop using another nested for .. in loop

// for second function:

// set var winner as a function
// let voteCount be an argument
// loop through each nested object in voteCount
// store all votes in an array
// sort the array
// take the highest value
// push that value into officers object

// Reflection

// This was a difficult exercise. It was difficult mostly because I was writing it in
// JavaScript, and I've already discussed how I lack understanding in JS. Not much more
// to say other than the only way I solved this was by looking at examples of solutions
// and going from there.
