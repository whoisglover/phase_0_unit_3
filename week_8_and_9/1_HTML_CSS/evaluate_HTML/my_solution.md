## Evaluate a Website! 
 
1) How does this website follow HTML Best Practices? Are there any places where 
it does not?  Provide examples of the "bad" code.
 - This page uses tables and divs really well to seperate each part of the page
 - It seems like a lot of their styling is done inline in the HTML instead of in the CSS page, I was always taught this was bad practice.  Here is an example:
 
            <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="85%" bgcolor="#F6F6EF">
                <tr>
                    <td bgcolor="#FF6600">
                        <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%" style="padding:2px">
                            <tr>
2) What do you think of the HTML? Did the writers use IDs and Classes properly? 
 - Classes were used properly but not enough in my opinion. Like I stated previously more of the styling should have been in the css page which wouldve required more classes and id's
Did you like the way they used HTML tags?  Please use examples with your arguments.
 - I don't necessarily like or dislike the way they used html tags, it was really quite standard since the entire page was pretty much tables.  I guess I did like this simplicity.. example:
 -  <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
                            <tr>
                                <td align="right" valign="top" class="title">
                                    1.
                                </td>
                                <td>
                                    <center>
                                        <a id="up_7801834" href="vote?for=7801834&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%6e%65%77%73" name="up_7801834"></a>
                                        <div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div><span id="down_7801834"></span>
                                    </center>
                                </td>
                                <td class="title">
                                    <a href="https://medium.com/p/2a7af4788b10">Python 3 can revive Python</a> <span class="comhead">(medium.com)</span>
                                </td>
                            </tr>
                            <tr>
                                <td colspan="2"></td>

3) How did the authors handle formatting? Did they include it in the HTML or 
separate it into a CSS file? Or did they do both?  Again, include examples.
 
4) Did the authors include anything you didn't immediately understand? 
If so, what?
 
5) How did the authors organize the CSS file? Was it DRY?
 
6) Did the authors incorporate any responsive design into the site?
 
7) What are your overall thoughts on the HTML/CSS from this website based on 
what you've read?
