## Release 0: Copy your Blog Template

## Release 1: Select a topic

### Option 1: Revisit EQ: Feedback 

Revisit [EQ & Feedback](http://vimeo.com/76762772) and read:
- [How to Give Feedback that Works](http://www.forbes.com/sites/prettyyoungprofessional/2011/05/16/how-to-give-feedback-that-works/)
- [Receive Feedback with Grace and Dignity](http://humanresources.about.com/cs/communication/ht/receivefeedback.htm)
- [Find the Coaching in Criticism](http://hbr.org/2014/01/find-the-coaching-in-criticism/ar/1)

Consider the feedback you've given and received on Feedbackinator. When was it most useful? When was it less useful? How did feedback either reinforce or encourage you to modify behavior when pairing? Does feedback always have to be negative? How can you give meaningful positive feedback?


When you arrive at DBC, you'll be expected to give live feedback to your peers, so consider some strategies for giving and receiving live feedback. 

### Option 2: Your thinking style

Remember your [Gregorc Thinking Style](http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm) from your pre-Phase 0 work? If you can't remember what you are, retake the [personal thinking style](http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html) quiz. 

Now research your thinking style and consider how you can use your understanding of your thinking style to your advantage at DBC.

Consider your experience in Phase 0 to this point. What has been the biggest struggle for you? Is it related to the way you think and learn or is it related to something else. If it's related to your learning style, start thinking of strategies to help you. Put some plans of action in place. 


## Release 2: Write your Blog!
Feedback has been one of the most interesting and rewarding parts about phase 0 of Dev Bootcamp.  Like most things DBC I had no idea what to expect but have been pleasantly surprised by the outcome.  Positive feedback has served as a really nice boost when I'm feeling bogged down in the challenges.  I think the most important feedback however is that which points out things I wasn't doing well.  Specifically things that I wasn't doing well AND didn't realize.  For instance one piece of feedback I received commented on the fact that I was moving too quickly through the code.  While coding alone its obvious to move at the speed your brain wants to, but this isn't the case when someone else is involved.  Hearing this from a peer I had recently worked with helped me realize this and take more notice of the speed at which I was working in my future pairings.  DBC's emphasis on providing kind, specific, and actionable feedback makes hearing negative feedback much easier and lets me change my habits quickly without getting offended by criticism.
