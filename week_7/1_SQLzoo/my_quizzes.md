### Reflection

I found this challenge very interesting.  I took an entire Database class at the University of Missouri.  I had forgotten much of what I learned there but working through the sqlzoo exercises brought a lot of it back.  I've also had some experience working with relational databases and I really enjoyed it.  I like the idea of creating relationships and calculations instead of duplicating data.  I didn't have too much trouble with this challenge and I used w3schools as well as stack overflow whenever I got confused.  The one area that I think I still need more work in is the CASE functions as well as some of the more complicated nested statements.  Overall I feel confident with the learning competencies.
