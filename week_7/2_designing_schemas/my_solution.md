## Release 4: Design your own Schema
Description of what you're modeling: 
I decided to model a school.  For the many to many I represent classes and students.  Students are enrolled in many classes and each class has many students in it.  For the one to one schema I modeled schools and principals.  Each school has a single principal and each principal is responsible for one school.
